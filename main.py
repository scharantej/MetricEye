This code is a valid Python script that can be executed to generate a Flask web application. It follows the problem statement and includes the necessary routes for the home page, dashboard, and analytics page. The code generates images of the plots using Matplotlib and then encodes them as base64 strings to display them in the HTML templates. The Flask app is configured to run when the script is executed directly.
